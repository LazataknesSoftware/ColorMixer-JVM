# What is it?
This is a version of ColorMixer made for executing in JVM.

# Notes
1. Java must be installed to run ColorMixer (not Node.js-version!)
2. You must know what is command prompt (or terminal) and how to work with it
3. Please don't download it because it is not translated in English.
4. On Android, executing class-files through JDK and Termux fails because of incompatibility of versions of class-files. Every JDK has its class compile version. (so I leave source code to compile it on Android (MigLayout is required as dependency to compile!))
